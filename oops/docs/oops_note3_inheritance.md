# Inheritance - a fundamental concept of OOPS

> A class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class  

* A **new** class (called a **child class** or **subclass** or **derived class**) inherits attributes and methods from another **existing** class (called a **parent class** or **superclass** or **base class**)  
* Allows the child class to **use** the methods and properties of the parent class, and also **modify** or **extend** them if needed  
* **Inheritance** allows to reuse and extend the existing code

### Types of Inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from one parent class.
2. **Multiple Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from more than one parent class.
3. **Multilevel Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from another subclass, forming a chain.
4. **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single parent class.
5. **Hybrid Inheritance**: A combination of two or more types of inheritance.

> we use the `super()` built-in function to call (access methods and attributes) from the parent class

### **Overriding**: If a method in the child class has the same name as a method in the parent class, the child's method will override the parent's method.
