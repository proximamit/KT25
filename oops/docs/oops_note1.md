# OOPS - Object-Oriented Programming System

## Objects - instances of classes  
---
**class** - encapsulate data and behavior  

### a class defines attributes and methods  

**Attributes** - *data or properties of an object*  
**Methods** - *functions or behaviors that the object can perform*  

**Instance variables** - variables that are specific to each object of the class  
**Instance methods** - methods that can be called on each object of the class  
---
### Inheritance - Allows code reuse  
> To create subclasses that inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. 

### Inheritance is a way to create new classes based on existing classes, inheriting their attributes and methods  
---
> class - a blueprint or template for creating objects that share similar attributes and behaviors 

> object - an instance of a class that has its own set of attributes and methods 
---
### Polymorphism - The ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context  
---
### Encapsulation - The practice of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through methods  
---
### Abstraction - The process of reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary details, allowing to focus on the essential features of an object or system
