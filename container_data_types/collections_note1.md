# Collections (Container data types) 

- **Container data types** also known as ***Collections*** in Python are used to store and organize multiple items (data)
- **Collections** are data structures that **hold or contain other objects**
- **Container data types** are fundamental to writing effective, clean, and efficient Python code
- These can be broadly categorized into ***built-in collections*** and specialized collections provided by the ***collections module*** from Python's standard library

---
### Mutable and Immutable

- ***mutable*** - Something that **CAN be changed** after it's created
- ***immutable*** - Something that **CANNOT be changed** once created

---
## Built-in Collections

There are **four main built-in container types**

| Type                              | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------| --------------------------------------------- |
| `list`                            | Ordered, mutable sequence of items            |
| `tuple`                           | Ordered, immutable sequence of items          |
| `set`                             | Unordered, mutable collection of unique items |
| `dict` **Before Python 3.7**      | Unordered collection of key-value pairs       |
| `dict` **Python 3.7 and later**   | Ordered collection of key-value pairs         |
### Lists

### Tuples

### Dictionaries

### Sets

## collections module in Python's standard library 
- Provides specialized collections
- The `collections` module provides enhanced versions of built-in types and new specialized containers for specific use cases
