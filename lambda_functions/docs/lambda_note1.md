# Lambda functions

## A lambda function is a small anonymous function
---
### Anonymous function means that a function is without a name
### A lambda function can take any number of arguments separated by commas, but can only have one expression

### Syntax
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

- **def** keyword is used to define the normal functions  
- **lambda** keyword is used to create anonymous functions  
---

- Every lambda function always return something, even if it's None
- We cannot use a return statement inside a lambda as it's a single expression function only
- lambda is handy if we want to call the function only once and can easily define it in a single line of code
